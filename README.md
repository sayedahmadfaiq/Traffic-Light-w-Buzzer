# Traffic-Light-w-Buzzer
First ever project using Arduino UNO R3 that I recently learnt and have gotten into developing passion projects
I started from learning from a youtube tutorial for sequencing lights, coding and the arrangement. 
Withh a bold idea to add a buzzer to it since it looked like a traffic light. Then I developed a buzzer to be used during the yellow light before turning red. This specific project took me 3 hours to complete the hardware, and coding whilst also handling any errors faced during the process. Will start working on many passion projects from now
